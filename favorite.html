            <p>During my senior year of high school, my friends and I took a senior trip to Gatlinburg, Tennessee. We spent a week in a beautiful wooden cabin surrounding by endless trees. The wooden porch is pictured in the middle image above. I spent a lot of time reading on this porch swing! On the left is an image of a small stack of rocks in a small creek we passed on one of our many hikes. I used to make these rock towers as a child so I had to snap a photo. On the far right is a rushing river beneath a bridge. The road that this bridge is a part of is Cades Coves Road. This is an 11-mile one way scenic loop that many tourists drive through. We stopped off of the side of this road to find our way to a waterfall! Sadly, the waterfall is not pictured here, but trust me when I tell you it was beautiful. Ultimately, this trip was very special to me because I love the mountains! Growing up in Illinois, I had never seen mountains this big. It was the first time I truly understood what a landscape may look like with large mountains and great hiking.</p>

                <p class="home_intro">An hour north of Chicago and 15 minutes south of the Wisconsin border lies Lindenhurst, Illinois. This is where I grew up in my family of six. I often spent my time outside whenever the weather would permit or my family and I would head to downtown Chicago to visit my older brother. While Lindenhurst may be a small town, below lies a collection of photos representative of my time living in Illinois.</p>

                    <p class="text_home_one">This is a painting by Edward Hopper titled Nighthawks. I had the joy of seeing this painting in person at The Art Institute of Chicago this past Summer of 2022. Despite living so close to Chicago, this was my first visit to the Art Institute! It was a particularly hot Summer day, but the incredible collection of artwork I sw this day made up for it. I feel fortunate to have grown up so close to a major city filled with memorable landmarks. </p>

I have spent hours walking my dogs here, biking with my mom, catching up with friends, and going for runs whenever nice weather came around. We didn't have this trail until I was in middle school, and I am lucky that it came when it did!</p>

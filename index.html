                <p class="home_intro">An hour north of Chicago and 15 minutes south of the Wisconsin border lies Lindenhurst, Illinois. This is where I grew up with one sister, two brothers, and two dogs. I often spent my time outside whenever the weather would permit or my family and I would head to downtown Chicago to visit my older brother. While Lindenhurst may be a small town, we found ways to have some fun! Below lies a collection of photos representative of my time living in Illinois.</p>

                    <p class="text_home_one">This is a painting by Edward Hopper titled Nighthawks. I had the joy of seeing this painting in person at The Art Institute of Chicago this past Summer of 2022. Despite living so close to Chicago, this was my first visit to the Art Institute! It was a particularly hot Summer day, but the incredible collection of artwork I saw this day made up for it. I feel fortunate to have grown up so close to a major city filled with memorable landmarks.</p>

                    <p class="text_home_two">This trail lies in the back of my neighborhood. I have spent hours walking my dogs here, biking with my mom, catching up with friends, and going for runs whenever nice weather came around. We didn't have this trail until I was in middle school, and I am lucky that it came when it did!</p>

                    <p class="text_home_three">This is the same boardwalk in Millennium trail, but this time captured at sunset. Sunset walks have always been a way for me to relax at the end of the day with some good music or an interesting podcast.</p>

                    <p class="text_home_eight">I took this photo after a Cubs win! Don't ask me who was playing, though. Growing up in a family with three boys, sports were everywhere. I often spent my days in elementary school attending little league baseball games and football games. Wrigley Field is special because this is where my Dad and Grandpa took my sister and I to see our first professional baseball game.</p>

                    <p class="text_home_nine">Wrigley Field is also a great concert venue. I saw Dead & Company for the first time in the Summer of 2022 with my Dad. It was an awesome concert and Wrigleyville was packed! I have tickets to see them again on Wrigley Field in the Summer of 2023!</p>
